#Cat Chat
##Description
I was part of a three-person team that created a chat application. I wrote the backend for our application, which is the code in this repository. To use the chat application, go <a href="http://KeithReynoldsWorld.github.io"> here </a>
##Features
- Usernames
- All messages can be seen by other users in real time
- Timestamped messages
- Basic swear word filter
- Multiple chatrooms
- Statistics about top chatroom, active users, and top ten users
- A chatbot that responds when users type "amiright", "is anyone here?", "meow", and "woof."

##Instructions
- To view all of the messages, send a GET request to `http://keithreynoldsworld.github.io/` or `http://keithreynoldsworld.github.io/messages`
